	    <h1>About Linda</h1>
		<div class="atext">
		<p2>My name is Linda Jones. I am a real fan of science fiction and fantasy books. My love for these genres began when I was about 12 years old. My older sister came home from college(yes, she is several years older than I am) and brought me a copy of 'The Hobbit', by J.R.R. Tolkein.  I was already an avid reader, but mostly of the kinds of things that 12-year olds read back then. Once I read this book I was hooked. It wasn't long before I was begging her for the rest of the books. Now that I knew this type of literature existed, I started reading more. One of the next series I read was 'The Dragonriders of Pern', by Anne McCaffrey. These were very different, but still part of the fantasy genre. Probably my sophmore year of college I started reading the 'Dune' series by Frank Herbert. That was probably my first introduction to Science Fiction. I found this to be awesome as well.<br><br>My love of these types of books has taken me a lot of places, from the great to the 'Oh my, how did I read that whole thing!'. Over the last 30 years I have collected the ones I felt were the best and have them in my home library. Some are hard cover, my preference, some are paperback. I have determined that we are losing touch with 'real' books, there's nothing like holding the physical copy and flipping the pages. A kindle just doesn't look or feel the same. With that determination I have decided to allow my friends to use this website to check out my books(and hopefully return them). I hope that it will be a great experience for all of us.</p2>
